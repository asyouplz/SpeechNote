## Project Work Principles

-   If you have existing code, first check if it's workable by modifying it.
-   Always find and update related documentation after code modifications are complete.
-   Actively collaborate with other agents.

## Code and Script Work Principles

1. When modifying code, first consult @agent-mentor-educational-guide for guidance.
2. @agent-systems-architect seeks advice from @agent-backend-api-infrastructure and @agent-code-refactorer.
3. Then, @agent-documentation-expert modifies the related documentation.
4. @agent-backend-api-infrastructure and @agent-code-refactorer restructure the code.
5. @qa-testing-expert code restructuring end, Always restructure the code only when QA passes. If pass fails, restructure the code again.
6. Always find and update related documentation after code modifications are complete.
