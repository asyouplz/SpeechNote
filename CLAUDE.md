## Project Work Principles

- If you have existing code, first check if it's workable by modifying it.
- Always find and update related documentation after code modifications are complete.
- Actively collaborate with other agents.

## Code and Script Work Principles

1. When modifying code, first consult @agent-mentor-educational-guide for guidance.
2. @agent-systems-architect seeks advice from @agent-backend-api-infrastructure and @agent-code-refactorer.
3. Then, @agent-documentation-expert modifies the related documentation.
4. @agent-backend-api-infrastructure and @agent-code-refactorer restructure the code.
5. Always find and update related documentation after code modifications are complete.
